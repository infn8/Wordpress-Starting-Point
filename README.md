Wordpress-Starting-Point
========================

My own oppinionated starting point for Wordpress.  


Requires [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) but because this is distributed for free I cannot include those files in this repo.  Buy them for $100 forever.  They're awesome.  If you're building enough themes to need a reusable starting point you should be able to afford it!
